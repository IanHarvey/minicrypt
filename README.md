minicrypt
=========

This is a library containing a cryptographic primitives intended for embedded systems.

Its key features are:
- optimised for the smallest code and data size.
- portable C, with minimal dependence on runtime environment. 
- includes test vectors.
- all code is placed into the public domain.

I am also including the Python models I've used when developing the code.
